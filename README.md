## Description

This projet's goal is to visualize different pathfinding algorithms in a grid and how it reacts to different obstacles and returns the shortest Path from the start to end nodes.
As of today 4 algorithms are supported:
### A* Pathfinding Algorithm
### Breadth First Search
### Bi-Directional Breadth First Search
### Dijkstra (unweighted)
