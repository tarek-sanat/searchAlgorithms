## Description

This projet's goal is to visualize different pathfinding algorithms in a grid and how it reacts to different obstacles and returns the shortest Path from the start to end nodes.
As of today 4 algorithms are supported:
### A* Pathfinding Algorithm
  Guarentees the sortest path and is faster than the other algorithms. Uses 
### Breadth First Search
  Guarantees shortest path. Explores each neighbor node of the graph until it finds the End node or doesn't have any remaining nodes to visit.
### Bi-Directional Breadth First Search
  Perform Breadth First Search on both Start and End nodes. When the two connect, reconstruct the shortest path.
### Dijkstra (unweighted)
  Unweighted Dijkstra means that the cost from a node to a neighbor node will be 1. It will return a similar result to breadth first search.
